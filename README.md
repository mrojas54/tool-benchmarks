# tool-benchmarks

A re-runnable harness that analyzes **tooling inefficiencies across agent
systems** — Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, and other
[AgentsView](https://github.com/)-supported runtimes — from their on-disk
session transcripts. The goal is evidence for where agent work wastes
context, time, retries, or tool calls, emitted as a single markdown report.

Builds on the native-tool-vs-Bash benchmarking methodology from claude-mem
observation #8376.

## What it measures

1. **Cross-agent tool cost** — which tools, agents, projects, and workflows
   dump the most context back into sessions.
2. **Tooling inefficiency patterns** — repeated failed calls, slow tools,
   edit churn, retry loops, context pressure, subagent fan-out.
3. **Deferral / discovery tax** — what deferred-tool loading and searching
   (e.g. `ToolSearch`) costs across Claude Code, Codex, and Hermes.
4. **Controlled tool-vs-shell probes** — for comparable local tasks, when
   native tools (Grep/Glob/Read) are cheaper or more reliable than shell
   commands.

The primary metric is **context cost** = joined tool-result payload tokens
(`chars / 4`). Cache flags are caveat-only and never rank tools; failure /
slow / retry-churn feed the inefficiency callouts only.

## Scope guards (non-goals)

- **Markdown only** — no HTML report (the `session-report` skill owns that).
- **No live token-API calls** — all numbers derive from on-disk transcripts.
- **Read-only** — never mutates transcripts or the probe corpus's source
  projects.
- **Python standard library only** — no third-party runtime dependencies, so
  the harness runs anywhere `python3` exists.
- **No web-chat benchmarking** — local/agentic surfaces with inspectable
  sessions only.

## Architecture

```
raw roots + AgentsView exports
          │
 source adapters (transcript.py + sources.py)
          │
     ┌────┴─────┐
 passive.py   probe.py
     └────┬─────┘
   reports/YYYY-MM-DD-tool-usage.md
```

- **`transcript.py`** — parses a session's JSONL, joining each assistant
  `tool_use` block to its result by id, and normalizes payloads to a
  character length. Malformed lines are counted and skipped, never fatal.
- **`sources.py`** — multi-agent discovery. Either scans raw local transcript
  roots or pages the AgentsView CLI (`--index-source auto | agentsview |
  raw`). `auto` tries AgentsView first and falls back to raw scanning,
  recording the reason.
- **`passive.py`** — streams and aggregates **incrementally** (per-agent /
  per-tool reducers only, never a whole-corpus `list[ToolCall]`), then emits
  a four-section report: agent breakdown, tool leaderboard, inefficiency
  callouts, summary.
- **`probe.py`** — runs matched tool-vs-Bash probe pairs over the vendored
  corpus and emits a context-token comparison table under `reports/`.

## Probe corpus

Five files are vendored under [`tools/`](tools/) — a log-spaced size spread
(~121 → ~2,242 lines) so the tool-vs-Bash comparison shows how context cost
scales with target size:

| File | Lines |
|------|-------|
| `regex_check.py` | 121 |
| `mcp.py` | 352 |
| `monitor.py` | 768 |
| `llm_extraction.py` | 1,332 |
| `code_analysis.py` | 2,242 |

They are committed so probes re-run from a clean checkout with no external
absolute paths. Probe *output* lands in `reports/`, kept separate from these
inputs.

## Status

**Implemented.** `toolbench/` ships all of tickets **T1–T6** in
[`BUILDPLAN.md`](BUILDPLAN.md): the scaffold, the transcript parser, the
multi-agent source layer, the passive analyzer, and the active probes. The
strict gate (`ruff`, `mypy --strict`, `unittest`) is green — 145 tests passing.

Source-of-truth documents:

- [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) — 25 numbered acceptance criteria (S1–S25).
- [`EVALUATION.md`](EVALUATION.md) — verification map for every criterion.
- [`BUILDPLAN.md`](BUILDPLAN.md) — decided architecture and the T1–T6 tickets.
- [`docs/2026-07-07-tool-benchmarks-design.md`](docs/2026-07-07-tool-benchmarks-design.md)
  — full v2 design spec.
- [`protocols/active-probes.md`](protocols/active-probes.md) — probe corpus,
  sentinels, and the seeded `#8376` baseline table.

## Agents / targets

Three source adapters. The first two are selected per-session by
`--index-source`; the third is selected by agent.

- **Claude Code raw transcripts** — scans on-disk JSONL session files
  directly under a root (default `~/.claude/projects`).
- **AgentsView** — pages the `agentsview` CLI for any AgentsView-registered
  runtime (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, …), yielding one `SessionRef` per
  session with cursor-based pagination.
- **Hermes SQLite** — reads hermes sessions straight from `~/.hermes`
  (`$HERMES_HOME` overrides). `agentsview session export` returns `rc=0` and
  streams the whole 37 MB default-profile database for every hermes session
  instead of that session's transcript, so hermes contributed zero tool calls
  until this adapter landed (TB-11).

Hermes **discovery** still comes from AgentsView; only the read is redirected.
The corpus is *defined* as what `agentsview session list` returns, and every
agent is sampled through that one path. Enumerating the hermes archive here
would redefine the corpus for a single agent and skew every cross-agent rate.

**Known limitation.** Hermes is under-sampled. `agentsview session list --agent
hermes` reports 89 sessions while `agentsview stats --agent hermes` reports 789
from the same archive — one binary, two subsystems, an 8.9× disagreement. That
is an upstream defect
([kenn-io/agentsview#1048](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview/issues/1048)),
not a curation to work around by forking discovery into one adapter. The export
bug this adapter exists for is
[#1047](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview/issues/1047).

## Usage

The project is [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)-managed (`pyproject.toml` +
`uv.lock`, empty runtime deps, `dev` group `ruff`/`mypy`/`pytest`).

```sh
# Passive analyzer — default scope is every agent, every project
uv run python -m toolbench.passive --agent all --all

# Scope by project / time / index source
uv run python -m toolbench.passive --project my-repo --since 2026-06-01
uv run python -m toolbench.passive --all --index-source agentsview
uv run python -m toolbench.passive --all --date-from 2026-06-01 --date-to 2026-06-30
uv run python -m toolbench.passive --all --exclude-subagents --out reports/2026-07-08-tool-usage.md

# Active tool-vs-Bash probes — omit --session for an all-seeded table
uv run python -m toolbench.probe
uv run python -m toolbench.probe --session /path/to/probe-session.jsonl --out reports/active-probe-comparison.md

# Tests
uv run python -m unittest discover tests
```

### `--index-source` policy

- `auto` (default) — tries AgentsView first; on failure, falls back to
  scanning the raw root directly and records the fallback reason in the
  report's Summary section.
- `agentsview` — AgentsView only; a source error is fatal.
- `raw` — raw local transcript roots only; a source error is fatal.

The fast test suite is hermetic — it fakes the `agentsview` CLI, points
`$HERMES_HOME` at a fixture database, and never touches `~/.claude` or
`~/.hermes`, so the inner loop never depends on a live daemon. One test in
`tests/test_hermes.py` reads the real hermes archive to pin the schema
compatibility envelope, and skips when that archive is absent.

Hermes databases are always opened `file:…?mode=ro`. A running hermes owns
those files; the adapter never writes to them.

## Quality gate

Before any PR: `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run mypy --strict toolbench tests`,
and the full unittest suite must be green.
