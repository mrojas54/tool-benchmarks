"""Complex debug probe: locate-then-fix over four toolset arms.

The active probe (S16-S18) measures cost per call, with the call dictated by a
run sheet -- which is what makes it honest, and also why it cannot answer "which
toolset should I reach for". A tool that costs 3x per call but needs a third as
many calls is free.

This module measures tokens to a *verified outcome* instead. The price is that
the agent chooses its own path, so step count dominates; everything here exists
to keep that measurable.
