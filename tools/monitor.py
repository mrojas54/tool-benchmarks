"""RuntimeMonitor — intercepts agent actions and enforces det contracts.

This is the central enforcement point.  Every agent action flows through
``check_action()``, which runs the deterministic evaluation pipeline:

    action -> append to trace -> ground(trace) -> for each Contract:
        eval assumption -> if holds, eval enforcement
    -> pass:  action allowed
    -> fail:  DetBlock | EscalateToHuman | WarnOnly

Each ``Contract`` is a single (assumption, enforcement) pair. Contracts
are evaluated independently: an assumption on one contract never gates
the enforcement of another contract.

This build is det-only. The LLM-judged stochastic pipeline (sto
evaluator + retry / redirect strategies + feedback generator + the
sto-specific dispatch this module used to host) is an extension point
not part of this build. ``BaseGuard`` keeps a public
``sto_evaluator: StoEvaluator | None`` hook (typed against
:mod:`sponsio.protocols.sto`) and delegates to it through the
``check_soft`` / ``refine`` surface; this monitor stays oblivious.

    """Runtime enforcement monitor for multi-agent systems.

    Intercepts agent actions, evaluates them against det contracts,
    and applies per-constraint enforcement strategies. Sto contracts
    (LLM-judged atoms) are an extension point that this monitor does
    not handle directly; ``BaseGuard`` routes those through its own
    ``StoEvaluator`` hook.

    Thread safety: ``check_action``, ``reset``, ``import_trace``, and
    the ``log`` / ``turn_spans`` snapshot accessors are serialised by
    an internal :class:`~threading.RLock`. This is the configuration
    that matters for the FastAPI demo server (``api/state.py``,
    thread-pool sync routes) and the MCP proxy
    (``sponsio.integrations.mcp``, one proxy shared across concurrent
    tool clients). Callbacks fire *outside* the lock so a slow exporter
    (dashboard HTTP, OTel) can't stall the agent loop. Contract
    authoring APIs on the underlying ``System`` (e.g.
    ``system._contracts.append``) are **not** guarded; treat contracts
    as write-once at startup.

    Args:
        system: The System whose contracts are being enforced.
        policy: Mapping of constraint descriptions to enforcement strategies.
        mode: Enforcement mode. ``"enforce"`` (default) runs strategies

            evaluates every contract but downgrades all violations to
            ``"observed"`` so nothing is blocked; callbacks still fire,
            so a ``SessionLogger`` hooked into the monitor captures the
            full record of what *would* have happened under real
            enforcement.
        hard_evaluator: Deprecated. Previously accepted a ``DetEvaluator``
            for custom hard predicates; the value was stored but never

            enforcement on their custom predicates. Kept as a kwarg for

        ``always_followed_by(a, b)`` / whole-trace ``rate_limit(tool, N)``
        — lose visibility across the rotation boundary. Concretely: if
        ``response`` was promised before ``rotate_session`` and still
        hasn't happened, the post-rotation verifier won't see the
        original ``trigger`` and can never fire the liveness violation.
        To avoid silently eating obligations, this method refuses to
        rotate while ``finish_session`` hasn't been called on a guard
        with pending liveness obligations — but since ``RuntimeMonitor``
        doesn't know about guard-level ``finish_session``, the check
        has to happen one layer up. See
        :meth:`sponsio.integrations.base.BaseGuard.rotate_session` for
        the guard-side handling: run ``finish_session`` first, then
        rotate.
